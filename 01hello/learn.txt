main() is the entry point in execution

When you run this Go program, the Go compiler compiles the code into machine code (or bytecode, in some cases) suitable for the target platform.

The compiled program is then executed by the Go runtime environment.

The main() function is called automatically by the Go runtime when the program starts.

Inside main(), fmt.Println() function is called to print the standard output (usually the console).

Finally, the program terminates, and the execution ends.
